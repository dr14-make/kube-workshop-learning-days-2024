This is an example of using a [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps) (formerly Argo Tunnel) to route internet traffic into your Kubernetes cluster. The architecture we suggest is running your app in a Kubernetes [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/), and then running cloudflared in a separate [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/). Then cloudflared will proxy internet traffic into whichever Kubernetes Service it was configured to. Alternatively, if your cluster already has an ingress controller (e.g. Envoy), you can use cloudflared to expose the ingress controller to internet traffic.

1. If you haven't, login to you Cloudflare account to obtain a certificate.

```sh
$ cloudflared tunnel login
```

2. Create a tunnel, change `example-tunnel` to the name you want to assign to your tunnel.

```sh
$ cloudflared tunnel create example-tunnel
INFO[2020-09-05T10:48:34+01:00] Writing tunnel credentials to /Users/cf000197/.cloudflared/ef824aef-7557-4b41-a398-4684585177ad.json. cloudflared chose this file based on where your origin certificate was found.
INFO[2020-09-05T10:48:34+01:00] Keep this file secret. To revoke these credentials, delete the tunnel.
INFO[2020-09-05T10:48:34+01:00] Created tunnel example-tunnel with id ef824aef-7557-4b41-a398-4684585177ad
```

3. Upload the tunnel credentials file to your Kubernetes as a secret. You'll need to provide the filepath that the tunnel credentials file was created under. You can find that path in the output of `cloudflared tunnel create` above.

```sh
$ kubectl create secret generic tunnel-credentials \
--from-file=credentials.json=/Users/cf000197/.cloudflared/ef824aef-7557-4b41-a398-4684585177ad.json
```

4. Associate your Tunnel with a DNS record. Go to dashboard and create a CNAME targeting <tunnel ID>.cfargotunnel.com. In this example the tunnel ID is `ef824aef-7557-4b41-a398-4684585177ad`, so I will create CNAME targeting `ef824aef-7557-4b41-a398-4684585177ad.cfargotunnel.com`. You can create multiple CNAME records targeting the same tunnel.

    ![create CNAME](https://github.com/cloudflare/argo-tunnel-examples/blob/master/named-tunnel-k8s/create-cname.png?raw=true)

You can do this from the command line by running `cloudflared tunnel route dns <tunnel> <hostname>`. For example, `cloudflared tunnel route dns example-tunnel tunnel.example.com`. You can use a similar method to route traffic to cloudflared from a [Cloudflare Load Balancer](https://www.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/), see [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/routing-to-tunnel/lb) for details.

5. Deploy cloudflared by applying its manifest. This will start a [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) for running cloudflared and a [ConfigMap](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/) with cloudflared's config. When Cloudflare receives traffic for the DNS or Load Balancing hostname you configured in the previous step, it will send that traffic to the cloudflareds running in this deployment. Those cloudflared instances will proxy the request to your app's Service.

```sh
$ kubectl apply -f cloudflared.yaml
deployment.apps/cloudflared created
configmap/cloudflared configured
```

6. Examine status of the pod.

```
    $ kubectl get pods
    NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

    $ kubectl logs $(kubectl get pod -l app=cloudflared -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
